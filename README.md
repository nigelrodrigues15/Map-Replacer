# Map-Replacer

This is a chrome extention that replaces all cities on the star alliance map webpage with airport codes. 

## Usage

* Need to activate developer mode in Chrome in order to add the extension
* `Load unpacked` and navigate to the project folder
* Click on the extension icon when on desired webpage and all cities will be replaced with airport codes

## Future Considerations
* New list of airports required with city as key

## Issues
* No real way to distinguish between cities with the same name (ie. London, UK and London, Canada)
